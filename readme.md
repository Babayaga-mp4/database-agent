## Sample Output

    Entering new SQL Agent Executor chain...
    I need to find the total number of patients hospitalized during July 2020 from the database.
    Action: sql_db_query_checker
    Action Input:
    SELECT SUM(hospitalized)
    FROM hospital_data
    WHERE date >= '2020-07-01' AND date <= '2020-07-31'
    SELECT SUM(hospitalized)
    FROM hospital_data
    WHERE date >= '2020-07-01' AND date <= '2020-07-31';
    The query looks correct, I should execute it to get the total number of patients hospitalized during July 2020.
    Action: sql_db_query
    Action Input:
    SELECT SUM(hospitalized)
    FROM hospital_data
    WHERE date >= '2020-07-01' AND date <= '2020-07-31'
    Error: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such table: hospital_data

    I need to check the schema of the database to see if the table hospital_data exists.
    Action: sql_db_list_tables
    Action Input: all_states_history
    The table I need is not listed. I should check the schema of the database to find the correct table.
    Action: sql_db_schema
    Action Input: hospital_data
    Error: table_names {'hospital_data'} not found in database
    I need to verify the correct table names in the database.
    Action: sql_db_list_tables
    Action Input: all_states_history
    I should use the table "all_states_history" instead of "hospital_data" to find the total number of patients hospitalized during July 2020.
    Action: sql_db_query_checker
    Action Input:
    SELECT SUM(hospitalized)
    FROM all_states_history
    WHERE date >= '2020-07-01' AND date <= '2020-07-31'
    SELECT SUM(hospitalized)
    FROM all_states_history
    WHERE date >= '2020-07-01' AND date <= '2020-07-31';
    The query looks correct now. I should execute it to get the total number of patients hospitalized during July 2020.
    Action: sql_db_query
    Action Input:
    SELECT SUM(hospitalized)
    FROM all_states_history
    WHERE date >= '2020-07-01' AND date <= '2020-07-31'
    [(5535849.0,)]
    I now know the final answer.
